# Automatic_Solar_Tracker_System
This project aims to improve the efficiency of solar panels using an Arduino-based automatic solar tracking system. Unlike traditional fixed panels, this system dynamically adjusts the panel's angle throughout the day to maintain optimal alignment with the sun, thereby increasing energy output by 20–30%.

📌 Key Features
🌞 Single-axis tracking for enhanced solar energy capture

🧠 Arduino UNO as the central controller

🔍 LDR sensors to detect light intensity for directional tracking

⚙️ Servo motors for precise panel rotation

🔋 Rechargeable 18650 battery for consistent operation

💻 Combines hardware and software to create an efficient and responsive system

🧪 Implementation & Results
The prototype was tested in outdoor conditions and consistently outperformed fixed panels. It demonstrated reliable sun-tracking behavior and significantly improved energy efficiency with minimal power consumption.

📖 Components Used
Arduino UNO

LDR Sensors with Holder

Servo Motor (5V)

Polycrystalline Solar Panel

18650 Li-ion Rechargeable Battery

🧠 Working Principle
The system continuously compares light intensity on both sides of the panel using LDRs. When a difference is detected, the Arduino commands the servo motor to reorient the panel toward the sun, maximizing energy absorption.

📈 Goal
To contribute to a more sustainable and green future by improving renewable energy utilization through automation and embedded systems.
